# Spam Classifier Neural Net
Uses a custom made neural net and available data to train a model for classifying spam in the 'data' folder
Implemented utilizing a single output neuron, which outputs a value between 0 and 1, which is then rounded to output either 1 for True(ham) and 0 for False(spam).
The code is structured utilizing 'layer' objects, which each contain an amount of neurons, their biases, and their corresponding incoming weights.
Training is done by adding a set of inputs on what is at first a random set of weights, biases, etc. This creates an output which is compared against the real answer, after which the difference is moved back through the network, modifying weights and biases depending on how much impact the individual nodes had on the wrongness or rightness of the answer. This is repeated over several epochs, so each data point is covered several times, and as the model stops being consistenly more accurate, the learning rate modifications are changed less as the learning rate is decreased.
